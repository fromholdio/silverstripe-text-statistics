# silverstripe-text-statistics

Calculates statistics on page/object content, such as word count, readability scores/standards, reading time, etc, and displays the output in a CMS tab.

Works with [fromholdio/silverstripe-plain-text](https://github.com/fromholdio/silverstripe-plain-text), which handles the conversion of a page of (or other data objects) elemental areas/elements to plain text.

Requires Silverstripe 5+ (untested with 4.x but should work).

Relies on [davechild/textstatistics](https://github.com/DaveChild/Text-Statistics) for the standards/scores calculations.
